# Jolia's Beer Pong Table For ChilloutVR

NOTICE: The Table needs it own layer named BeerPongTable for it to work, see images below for more info.

A WIP beer pong table for ChilloutVR, just import it into your project, make sure you have TextMeshPro as well.

Requirements:
- Unity 2019.4.31f1
- ChilloutVR CCK 3.3
- Basic Unity and CVR knowledge.
- TextMeshPro - You can get this via Unity's package manager, it is free. We use a font from there.
- It's own layer called BeerPongTable (see images below).

Known Issues: 
If the ball is traveling it will sometimes jump out of cup holder on teleportation, I working on a way to freaze the ball in place when teleporting so this doesn't happen.

There are two versions to download.

Version 0.1 Features:
- 4 Row of cups and 5 row of cups choice of game.
- Ball reset button for each side.
- Decent physics, should work fine.

Version 0.2.1 Features (Current recomended): 
- 4, 5, 6 and 7 Row of cups.
- Better UI.
- Ball reset button for each side.
- Better physics then 0.1.
- Optional floor collider so when the ball hits the floor it will reset, note there is no way yet to detect which players turn it is so it will just reset to the left hand side. You can also make you own collider and set it to the BeerPongTable layer instead.

That's about it for now.

Things I am working on, (note some features may not be released for a while unto CVR makes it easier to make these things).

- Score board system.

How too add a layer:
